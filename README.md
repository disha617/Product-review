INTRODUCTION: 
In a world where people are increasingly conscious about what they eat, having a comprehensive tool that can analyze food ingredients, detect allergens, and provide nutritional insights  is crucial. The "Food Ingredient Reviewer" is a sophisticated application designed to help users make informed dietary choices. With features like manual and file-based  ingredient  input, database integration for ingredient information, allergen detection, nutrition analysis, and report generation, this project aims to be a versatile tool for consumers, dietitians, and health enthusiasts. Additionally, with capabilities to scan and extract ingredient lists from  images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and parsing techniques, it ensures that  users can easily understand the contents of their food, assess potential risks, and maintain  their well-being with minimal effort.
